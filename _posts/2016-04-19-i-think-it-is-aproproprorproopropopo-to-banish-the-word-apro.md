I think it is aproproprorproopropopo to banish the word aproproprorproopropopo to the depths of the deepest hell in existence, if not merely for possessing flagrantly on it's person the seeds of a gall manifesting itself on numerous occasions with repeating calls of plead to withdraw such creations, being forced to use the expression as loosely as the elastic strands which remain and maintain as closed a curtain we may ever hope for while containing voluminous pile so dense with years of yearning, that has over time managed to more accurately hit notes of a vinigarette that has clearly overshot it's name, thus a vinigar, with the only reprieve being that the solution has been allowed to wander afar over these past 14 years while shedding it's volume year over year, for the keeper of the kitchen, the loin if you will, the whack of weeds that have nested sporadically over the mound of a mons that has seen better days, in it's encore attempt to ignite it's own spark of existence, thinking before knowing that it never was before, and now has a moment.
